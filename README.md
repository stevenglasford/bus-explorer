This program is designed to enhance the ability to find interesting things along bus and train routes in the Minneapolis and St. Paul region.

Originally, the goal was to make an app that my mom could use to find interesting things to do along the bus lines.

She wanted an easier way to find items along the route.

The operation is easy. There will be two different forms of usage for this app, one containing the real time information, and one that explores the scheduled trips.
The scheduled trips is more robust as it can find trips that are outside of the user's desired times, which can be helpful in finding express routes for example.
The real-time side of the app will be deployed after the framework for the scheduled routes is complete, as many of the functions are needed between the two.

This is an example screenshot of the schedule explorer. The POIs button is new and has not been fully implemented as of this writing
A file of the example can be found in this repo under the name `![Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 23-02-10 Metro Transit Schedule Explorer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a58f3c8b-e740-4025-9dc9-fd0fc5ccc8d5)`
